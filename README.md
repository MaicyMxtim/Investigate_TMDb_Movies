# Investigate_TMDb_Movies

# Investigate_TMDb_Movies

The primary goal of the project is to go through the dataset and the general data analysis process using numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

## Project Overview
In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

## What do you need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

## Why this Project?
In this project, you'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.

You'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

## What will you learn?
After completing the project, you will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Tip: Now that you've trimmed and cleaned your data, you're ready to move on to exploration. Compute statistics and create visualizations with the goal of addressing the research questions that you posed in the Introduction section. It is recommended that you be systematic with your approach. Look at one variable at a time, and then follow it up by looking at relationships between variables.

## Research Questions
1. Which genres are most popular from year to year?
2. What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
3. Average Runtime Of Movies From Year To Year?
4. Which year had the most number of movies released?
5. Who is the most frequent actor?

## Conclusions
1. The most popular genre is Thriller, followed by War and then Western.
2. The Budget and Popularity of a movie directly affects its Revenue.
3. Movies with a comparatively shorter duration are becoming more popular as years go by.
4. 2011 released the highest number of movies i.e 398 movies. The next best year was 2010.
5. Matt Damon is the most frequent actor as he has appeared in 63 movies.

### Limitations
1. There were very many missing values that affect the accuracy of the analysis
2. The columns budget and revenue had many zeros which resulted in those entries being dropped from the analysis.
